This platform offers users the opportunity to prepare for interviews through 1:1 live sessions with mentors, receive performance feedback, and chat with mentors. Mentors can sign up through the admin dashboard and set their availability for meetings.

# üåê How to Test the system Online

- Step 1: Sign Up using your any email ID in a browser.
- Step 2: Sign Up pre registerd mentor in another different broweser or PC or device.
  - MENTOR SIGNUP DETAILS
    - Email: royanik08@gmail.com
    - Password: @aniK007
- Step 3: Book a session with the given mentor using your registerd account
- Step 4: now wait for the session status to ongoing and a joining button
- Step 5: Use the joining button from both mentor and mentee ( your account ) to get into the video meeting
- Step 6: If you end call from mentor account ANIK ROY you can see the Result status pop up from where you can give a rating based result
- Step 7: to chat with mentor just follow or add the mentor from the mentor by add icon on top of mentor session booking card and you will see the mentor at your chat box.
- Step 8: Now you can freely chat realtime with mentor (test it with both side it works).
- Step 9: To check the subscription options use the **demo card** information such as 4242424242424242 **DD/MM** 4242 **CVV** 424

# üñ•Ô∏è To test the system offline with local device
- Step 1: follow the installation, setup and running instructions to get the project in your device
- Step 2: register a mentee.
- Step 3: register a admin using the postman while running the system on your device via {{localhost url}}/admin/signup
  - use raw JSON data to make a POST request explained below
  
  ```
  {
    "name":"your name",
    "email":"your email id",
    "gender":"your gender as male/female/other",
    "password":"your password"
  }
  ```
  - Step 3: Login as Admin. To do that go at the bottom of the web page in the footer you will see the admin login button if not signed in already with other methods.
  - Step 4: Add a mentor from the admin dashboard.
  - Step 5: Test the system.
  - Step 6: make sure to modify the backend env file as your need since its a dummy env file for testing purpose. you need to add your relevent keys and information to make it work.
  - Step 7: make sure to add a env file in frontend and add this
    
    ```
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
    here localhost 3000 referes the backend running port if you use another port make sure to add that instead of this.
    NOTE: when testing locally its preferable to use the same browser as mentor and use incognito mode of that same browser as mentee or vice versa for video calling otherwise it will not work properly.

<em> 
‚ö†Ô∏è Addressing some problem that occour after deploying the site that is when you engaging in the video call for some reason you cant see your own video in the mini video box while you are atively streaming your video (But working perfectly fine in the local device). If you can find any solution to that feel free to connect me and let me know. Also in this deployed platform refreashing will show 404 page not fpund error since its a problem regarding the react router.

# üìå Future Scope
We will add a Mock test system so that user can test their knowledge and prepare themself by giving mock test (MCQ based). Admin can see more details about their sites and have more functionalities. Mentor login can be done using a single request to ther server and sending the actual signup link to its given mail id. Also try to incorporate the error issue regarding the self video preview window in the video meeting. The Subscription plans are there and also it will enflict the current pack but there is no connection with the actual functionalities, meaning with any kind of subscription user able to leverage all the functionalities right now, the restrictions are not made yet. Also much work needed to give a admin dashboard a decent UI and informations.
